        <p>My name is Mikael Weiss</p>
        <p>I am majoring in computer science and I am hoping to end up a full stack developer.</p>
        <p>I love to build things, I love to hang out with family and friends, and I love to read the scriptures.</p>
        <p>I can see it being a huge help to know web design because I can build my own websites, and I can also do it for others as a job. I particularly love building mobile apps, so it will be amazing to have a web version of those apps as well.</p>
        <p>I've been a member since I was 8, and I've loved every minute of it.</p>
        <p>Favorite quote: "As you choose to live on the lord's side, you are never alone." - President Nelson</p>
        <p>I'm so excited to be learning web development, and to learn to use a new IDE. So exciting!</p>
