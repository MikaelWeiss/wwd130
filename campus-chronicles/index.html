                <p>Everything we do at Campus Chronicles is to connect friends and
                    help
                    people remember the good times in
                    life. This website would be a fun little place for a friend group to post articles and columns each
                    week, keeping everyone laughing and up-to-date. Memory keeping is always hard, but this site will be
                    so
                    fun and easy to use it'd be harder not to use it.</p>

                        For Mark, life's one big adventure, and with Erica by his side, every moment is worth
                        cherishing.</p>
